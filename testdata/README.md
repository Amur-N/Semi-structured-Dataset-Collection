# testdata
[testdata](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/testdata) are small datasets for testing purpose (FASTQ, BAM).

The files with longer names are original logs, and those with shorter names are excerpted from corresponding original ones. This repo only includes parts of its original files.    
e.g. `COLO.fastq` is excerpted from `COLO829v003R_AHHKYHDSXX_S13_L001_R1_001.fastq`.
