# Loghub-2.0
[Loghub-2.0](https://github.com/logpai/loghub-2.0) is a large-scale evaluation for log parsing techniques. It contains even larger log files than [Loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub).

Some original files are too big, you need to unzip them from corresponding split compressed files.  
The files with the name suffix `_full` are original logs, and those with `_2` are excerpted from original ones.  
e.g. `Apache_2.log` is excerpted from `Android_full.log`.
