# UserClustering
[UserClustering](https://github.com/sjtuwrk/UserClustering) is a web log dataset.

The files with the name prefix `u_ex` are original logs, and those without `u_ex` are excerpted from corresponding original ones. This repo only includes parts of its original files. 
The original files are too big, you need to unzip them from corresponding split compressed files.   
e.g. `150301.log` is excerpted from `u_ex150301.log`.
