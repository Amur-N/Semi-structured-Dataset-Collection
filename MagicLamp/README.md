# MagicLamp
[MagicLamp](https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/MagicLamp) is a platform for targeted annotation of (meta)genomic and (meta)transcriptomic datasets using HMM sets.

The files with longer names are original logs, and those with shorter names are excerpted from corresponding original ones. This repo only includes parts of its original files.    
e.g. `190405.hmm` is excerpted from `190405_uniprotkb_gvpA.refseq_protein_35pident_70length_sequences.rep.alignment_automated1.hmm`.
